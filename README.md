I ended up not being able to get the data into a Database in a proper way, spending way too much time trying to make this dataset work. Therefore i will be describing what i would have done with it, had i been able to import it successfully:

## The data
The data is sourced from [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). It details the listings on their service, along with information about Hosts, reviews, and location data.

## The model
The model for the database consists of the following entities:
* Host - people who list accomodations on Airbnb
* Listing - a listing for an accomodation
* Review - a review of a listing
